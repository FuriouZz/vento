# Comments

Use `{{#` to start a comment and `#}}` to end it. The commented code will be
ignored by Vento.

```vento
{{# This is a comment! #}}
```

## Trimming spaces

Like other tags, it's possible to trim the space after and/or before a comment
using the `-` character.

```vento
<h1>
  {{#- This is a comment! -#}}
</h1>
```

The result is:

```vento
<h1></h1>
```
